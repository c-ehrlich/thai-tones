# TODO

- [ ] better TTS (Azure https://speech.microsoft.com/portal/voicegallery)
- [ ] enhance tone detection - return:
      - tone
      - consonant
      - consonant class
      - syllable dead or live (and why?)
      - tone marker
      - image?
      - [ ] ...and do something with this in ui
- [ ] UI that isn't dogshit
- [ ] SRS
- [ ] LocalStorage?
- [ ] ability to skew the algorithm - truncate at top 1k, standard, disproportionately show rare syls
- [ ] React Native? => would allow not needing a server...
- [ ] make some features paid - maybe neural voice, study mode, srs

# DONE
